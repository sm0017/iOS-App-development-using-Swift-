Project Description:

Objective:
recreate and enhance the table view and map view views. The essence of this application is to facilitate a scavenger hunt across the USM
campuses.
Access to a JSON data set that includes the locations of some
campus buildings. 

Application will load these and allow the user to navigate to
them and “check” them off when they are close by

Required Tasks
1. Create a new application using the SplitViewController. The Master view should be a
TableView and the Detail view will become a MapView that covers the entire view.
2. Create a model and associated classes to load the initial data over the network from
a JSON file.
3. Your model should include an additional “location visited” property that is an optional
NSDate. It will be nil if the user has not “found” that location and set to the date and
time it was visited.
4. In the table view, cells for locations that have been visited should show a
“checkmark”, rows of locations that have not been visited will have no indicator.
5. When the application is loaded and when the user “pulls to refresh” in the table view,
you should check for updates from the JSON data source.
6. On Refresh, merge any local data (visited date/times) with the changes.
7. When the user taps on a cell in the table view, the detail view should show a map
that includes an annotation for the location tapped and the user’s current location
8. When the user comes within “a few meters” of the location, display an alert that they
have found the location and update your model appropriately.
